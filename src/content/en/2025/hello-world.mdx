# Welcome to my Devlog!  

I’ll be sharing here my journey and explorations of new technologies, with the goal of creating and distributing new products.  

I’m starting by developing *showcase* apps, both mobile and web. Commercial apps will follow in the coming months.  

My main areas of interest are:  
- **mobile**  
- **audio** (DSP, VST/AU)  
- **music** (MIDI, theory)  
- **graphics** (3D, GPU, visualization)  
- **VR/XR** (Oculus Quest, Apple Vision)  
- the **cybersphere** in general (social networks, virality, IoT, etc.)  
- **generative AI**  
- **Web 3.0** (blockchain, cryptos). 

I’m also interested in creating **mini video games**, whether based on original ideas or adaptations.  

In the long run, I’ll operate under different banners:  
- **Osibits** for commercial distribution and freelancing  
- another entity for software production  
- a third one for content creation (sound, music, images, videos, 3D VFX, etc.)

✨ **Stay tuned!**
