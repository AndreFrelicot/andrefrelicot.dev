<br/>
Here is **LLMVoice**, a technical demo designed to evaluate the new iOS 26 speech recognition APIs (**SpeechAnalyzer / SpeechTranscriber**) and the execution of **open-weight LLM models** (quantized in **4 bits**) locally on an iPhone that supports the **MLX** framework. You can either summarize a transcription or send a prompt directly to the model.

Let’s be honest — models this compressed aren’t particularly useful, but it’s still fun to watch them hallucinate. That said, they’re powerful enough to bring my old iPhone 13 to its knees!

Here are the available downloadable models: <br/>
**Gemma3_1b** (mlx-community/gemma-3-1b-it-4bit) <br/>
**Qwen25_05b** (lmstudio-community/Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct-MLX-4bit) <br/>
**Llama32_1b** (mlx-community/Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit) <br/>
