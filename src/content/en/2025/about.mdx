# About

I've been a software developer (CTO, Architect, Tech Lead) for over 25 years, working in companies, startups, and as a freelancer.
I've contributed to a wide range of projects: management software, mobile apps integrating machine learning and video streaming, medical applications requiring advanced visualization systems (MedTech, DeepTech, distributed volume rendering, 4D Flow, GPU clusters in the cloud), as well as mobile apps using real-time Bluetooth LE communication (including firmware development for BLE peripherals).

In 2025, I'm starting a new chapter: exploring the opportunities offered by AI (LLMs, deep learning) to create new types of products. While remaining deeply rooted in technology, I'm also interested in new ways software is consumed: virality, customer acquisition through social media (UGC), and marketing strategies. Where software merges with content.

My role is evolving into that of a **Digital Strategist**, envisioning, distributing, and selling both mobile applications and SaaS solutions.

**Motto: Tech – Product – Business**
