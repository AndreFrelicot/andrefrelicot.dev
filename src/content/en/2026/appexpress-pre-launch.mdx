### AppExpress – Offer Pre-Launch

The **pre-release version of the AppExpress offer** is now live.

This is a first iteration of the offer as I envision it:
clear, readable, and execution-focused, ready to be used today to structure a project.

The goal is simple:
**reduce the distance between an idea and production.**

<div style={{marginTop: '2rem', marginBottom: '2rem'}}>
  <a href="https://appexpress.fr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
    <ThemeImage
      lightSrc="/images/2026/appexpress-og.jpg"
      darkSrc="/images/2026/appexpress-og.jpg"
      alt="AppExpress - From idea to production"
      width={600}
      height={315}
    />
  </a>
</div>

The platform already allows you to:
- build an offer from explicit building blocks
- get a budget and timeline estimate
- book a meeting
- or subscribe to the newsletter to follow the evolution of the offer

The estimate serves as a basis for discussion.
The final proposal is validated after an exchange, but the starting point is intentionally clear.

The offer is built on a few deliberate principles:
- a single point of contact from start to finish
- zero outsourcing
- a pragmatic, delivery-oriented approach
- the option to start with or without designs

Mobile, web, SaaS, or generative AI:
the objective is always the same, **deliver a functional product**.

### Next steps

- **Two demo projects** to concretely illustrate the offer and the building blocks used.
- **The AppExpress CRM**, allowing project progress tracking, discussions, and milestone validation,
  accessible via a web dashboard and a mobile app.

  The mobile app will be available in Ionic, React Native, and native (iOS Swift / Android Kotlin).

- **More generative AI–oriented projects**,
  to explore and demonstrate concrete use cases: **intelligent search, content generation, assistants, and automations.**
